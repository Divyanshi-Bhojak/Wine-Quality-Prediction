# Wine-Quality-Prediction
For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build  classification models Support Vector Machine and Random Forest to predict whether a particular red wine is “good” or "bad". The objectives of this project are as follows
1.To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
2.To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine
 The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input:
Fixed acidity,
Volatile acidity,
Citric acid,
Residual sugar,
Chlorides,
Free sulfur dioxide,
Total sulfur dioxide,
Density,
pH,
Sulfates,
Alcohol
